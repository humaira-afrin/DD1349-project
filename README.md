# üîê PasswordVault ‚Äì A Simple Password Manager

## Project Description
**PasswordVault** is a lightweight password manager with a graphical user interface (GUI) built in **...**  
It allows users to:
- Add and store login credentials (e.g. website, username, password)
- View saved credentials in a list
- Securely encrypt and decrypt all data using symmetric encryption (AES)  
With AES encryption:  
	  -	You encrypt all data before saving it to a file  
	  -	Only someone who knows the master password (i.e., the key) can decrypt and read the contents  
	  -	If someone opens the file directly, they will only see unreadable ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù data  
- Lock access behind a master password

This project is developed as part of the **DD1349 - Software Development with Java (Projinda)** course at KTH.

The goal is to deliver a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** with essential functionality while keeping the technical complexity manageable.
